# RGB color definition. Colors are refered to within configuration files
# by their name. In order to use a color, you must define it here. 
# 
# e.g. if you really must use 'bisque', then add
#
# bisque = 255,228,196
#
# Many useful colors are already defined. In general, given a HUE, these
# colors are defined
#
# vlHUE (very light HUE, e.g. vlred)
# lHUE  (light HUE, e.g. red)
# HUE   (e.g. red)
# dHUE  (dark HUE, e.g. dred)
#
# In addition to hues, two other color groups are defined. 
#
# - cytogenetic band colors (e.g. gposNNN, acen, stalk, etc.) which
#   correspond to colors on ideogram bands
# - UCSC chromosome color palette (e.g. chrNN, chrUn, chrNA)
